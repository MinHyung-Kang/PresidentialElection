# Understanding Twitter Network of the 2016 Presidential Election

## Abstract :

In this paper we consider the tweets posted by Twitter users on main candidates for the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, with the goal of extracting as much information as possible from the social media. Networks are constructed from scraped data, and various evaluations such as spectral clustering are performed to compare different networks. Non network-specific analyses, such as sentimental analysis and Word2Vec are also considered. We observe that the networks follow characteristics of a scale-free network, as well as that they accurately depict the relevant background information of the collected dataset in various manners. 


## Python Code

### Crawler :  
Code used to scrape the data from Twitter that matches the keyword

### WithoutConversion : 
Read in data, cleans the data, and exports each subnetwork to csv files 
- Divides into reply/retweet/mention edges
- Compute frequencies of each edge of each subnetwork
- Compute frequencies of the edges of combined network
- Finds top 5 users of each network

### Exploratory Analysis :
Plot the degree distribution, fit power law
- Try both python's default lib and plfit
- Look at distributin of time difference between tweet and retweet
- Plot general tweet distribution across time

### ReduceMatrix : 
Gets smaller portion of the network and symmetrize the edges
- Reduces the number of edges by filtering them by a threshold
- Symmetrizes the edges
- Constructs a dictionary through which one can convert from new indexing in matlab to old indexing and vice versa

### Sentiment Analysis:
Uses VADER library to perform sentiment analysis
- Get text per user
- Computes average sentiment per user

## CSV files

### ClusteringClass.csv :
Result of spectral clustering, includes classification for each user

### EdgesFrequencyReducedSymmetricNewLabel :
Newly labeld users and corresponding edges of the reduced/symmetrized dataset, to be used by matlab code.

### UserSentimentNewLabel :
Sentiment analysis result performed on the users of the reduced dataset.



Matlab Code
--------------
- ReadData.m : 
	Reads in files generated by python code, performs spectral clustering
	on the data to get the classification.
- SpectralClusteringAnalysis.m : 
	Uses the result of spectral clustering to label each nodes of the network,
	constructs and visualizes the network

Matlab Data File
-----------------
- sentimentedges_k5 : 
	Classes for each node of the network.
	Result of spectral clustering performed on the dataset and k-means performed, with k=5.

Java Code : 
--------------
- WordVec.java
	Used to compute word similarity of the network and get similar words for a keyword
